# UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset

Data File: ged171.csv
Data Source: https://www.prio.org/Data/Armed-Conflict/UCDP-PRIO/

## Ideas

- Train a classifier on severity of armed conflict by analyzing number of deaths, density of conflict, and potentially other variables
- See if we can find causative conflicts, i.e. ones that are the catalyst for other conflicts in a region
- Fuse armed conflict and other world bank data to see if we can predict future conflicts based on trends in healthcare, education, economic statistics. Try to confirm intuition about variables leading to conflicts
